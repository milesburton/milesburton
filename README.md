# Hey, I'm Miles

Software engineer who spends way too much time thinking about satellites and radio signals.

## What I'm Currently Building

I maintain **[Night Watch](https://github.com/milesburton/night-watch)** – an automated system for receiving and decoding satellite signals. It captures METEOR-M weather imagery and ISS SSTV transmissions, runs predictions for satellite passes, and serves a web dashboard with live specs and a 3D globe.

The project handles the entire workflow: predicting passes, controlling an RTL-SDR receiver, performing FFT analysis in real-time, and decoding the received signals. It'll happily run on a Raspberry Pi in the corner of a room if you let it.

## Tech

- **Languages**: TypeScript, Node.js, React
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions
- **Radio stuff**: RTL-SDR, FFT processing, LRPT/SSTV decoding, orbital mechanics

## Actually Interested In

- Satellite signal reception and processing
- Orbital mechanics and pass predictions
- Software Defined Radio (SDR) in general
- How amateur radio enthusiasts do things
- Building infrastructure that just works
- Making tools accessible to people doing cool things

## Currently Learning

- More sophisticated signal processing approaches
- Scaling across multiple SDR devices
- Container orchestration for hobbyist infrastructure

## Find Me

- GitHub: Obvious place, lots of projects here
- Email: Check my profile
- Amateur radio: Always happy to chat about antenna design or satellite passes

Feel free to reach out if you're doing anything interesting with satellites, SDR, or backend systems. Always keen to see what others are building.
