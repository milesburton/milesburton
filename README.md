# Hi, I’m Miles

I’m a software engineer with a long-standing interest in real-time systems, software-defined radio, and self-hosted infrastructure.

Over the years I’ve built and operated a mix of trading platforms, satellite reception systems, APRS and LoRa nodes, and small-scale energy and compute setups, with an emphasis on reliability, observability, and maintainability.

## What I Build

I usually work on systems that cover the full stack, from hardware and data capture through to processing, monitoring, and user-facing tools. This includes:

- automated satellite and weather image reception  
- SDR decoding pipelines (LRPT, SSTV, APRS)  
- self-hosted monitoring and visualisation dashboards  
- homelab and edge-compute infrastructure  
- small renewable and battery-backed power systems  

Most of these are designed to run unattended on modest hardware.

## Interests

- software-defined radio and satellite communications  
- real-time and event-driven software  
- small-scale infrastructure (RF, power, compute)  
- automation, monitoring, and testing  
- building practical tools that others can use  

## Tech I Use

**Languages**  
TypeScript, Node.js, React, Python

**Infrastructure**  
Docker, Docker Compose, Dev Containers, GitHub Actions, Linux

**Systems**  
WebSockets, streaming pipelines, observability, automation

**RF / Embedded**  
RTL-SDR, LRPT/SSTV, APRS, antenna design
